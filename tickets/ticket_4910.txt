Dear Sir/Madam,
I would like to cancel my subscription with StudyFlash.
The reason for this request is that I am unable to log in to my account and
therefore cannot use the service. Despite multiple attempts, I have not
been able to access my account.
I kindly ask you to cancel my subscription with immediate effect and to
confirm this cancellation by email. Please let me know if you need any
additional information from my side.
Thank you in advance for your assistance.
Kind regards,
Fienne speets
